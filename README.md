# MicroVAR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The MicroVAR is Microbiome Visualization and Analysis in R 

It integrates 16S rRNA data and shotgun metagenomics data using Phyloseq, generating diversity plots and taxonomy plots to visualize sample diversity and composition. Differential abundance analysis identifies significant microbial differences between groups, and microbial interaction networks are analyzed to understand the relationships between different taxa. Additionally, functional profiling with Picrust2, including KEGG annotation and pathway analysis, is performed and visualized.

- Alpha diversity measures the variety of species within a single sample. It tells us how many different species are present and how evenly they are distributed.
- Beta diversity compares the differences in species between different samples. It shows how unique or similar the species are across various environments.
- Taxonomy analysis identifies and classifies the species in a sample based on their genetic material. It helps determine which organisms are present and their abundance.
- Differential abundance analysis identifies which species or genes are present in different amounts between groups of samples. It helps in understanding how microbial communities change in response to different conditions or treatments.
- Microbial interaction networks map the relationships and interactions between different microbial species within a community. These networks reveal how species influence each other, which can help in understanding ecosystem stability and dynamics.
- Functional profiling assesses the functional capabilities of a microbial community by identifying the genes or pathways present. It provides insights into the metabolic activities and potential functions of the community, such as nutrient cycling or disease associations.
